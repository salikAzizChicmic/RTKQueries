The createApi function takes three arguments:

reducerPath: The name of the Redux reducer that will be used to manage the state of the API slice.
baseQuery: A function that is used to make HTTP requests.
endpoints: A function that is used to define the endpoints of the API slice.

The endpoints function takes a builder object as an argument. The builder object can be used to define the following types of endpoints:

query: A query endpoint is used to fetch data from the API.
mutation: A mutation endpoint is used to modify data on the API.
